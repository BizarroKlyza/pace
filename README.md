* The application will compile and run under debug

## Building the Project
* In order to build the project for deployment under the app directory execute "npm run build"
* This will compile the project to the build folder
* This will need to be run on a server of some kind
* There will need to be a redirect to the "index.html" file regardless of url typed in as the index.html file loads the compiled javascript and launches the application
